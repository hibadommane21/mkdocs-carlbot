# Triggers

!!! warning
    Autoresponses are not custom commands, if you want things that are triggered by a prefix and a keyword, see the tag section. They offer more functionality, better editing capabilities, will _never_ have a limit to them and are just generally nicer for their intended purpose.

!!! warning "Trigger Limits"
	Autoresponses **CANNOT** be more than 2000 characters in length. A server can only have 50 autoresponses. If more than 50 autoresponses exist on a server, any autoresponse after the 50th one alphabetically will no longer function. Embeds attached to autoresponse via the Dashboard are subject to the same limits detailed in the Embeds section.

| Name | Example | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[ar\|autoresponse]** | !ar | Lists the triggers, and ignores for the server |
| **ar list** | !ar list | Lists all the triggers in a paginated fashion |
| **ar [add\|create] &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;response&gt;** | !ar add "hi" Hello welcome to HI Barbiee! | Adds a trigger that carlbot will look for and say/do something when it is said. This command looks for a substring within the message, meaning that if you add _hi_ then _t_**hi**_s_ will also match. See the next command if that is too greedy for you. |
| **ar [strict\|s] &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;response&gt;** | !ar strict "sus" {reactu: üòè} | This works a lot like normal ar add with one vital exception: it looks for exact sequences of words, rather than substrings. What this means is that if you add the strict trigger `hell` and someone says `hello` it will not match, it also means that triggers with more than one word requires an exact match per word (this is a lot more reasonable to use than this text makes it out to be). |
| **ar [exact\|e] &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;response&gt;** | !ar exact "hey guys" Hello! | This matches if the content of a message is the same as the trigger. Some exceptions such as punctuation and capitalization applies. |
| **ar [startswith\|sw] &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;response&gt;** | !ar sw "how do i" read the wiki! | Matches if the start of the message matches |
| **ar [endswith\|ew] &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;response&gt;** | !ar ew "i think" no you don't | Like startswith except if it ends with it. |
| **ar [remove\|del\|-\|delete] &lt;trigger&gt;** | !ar del its coming home | Removes an autoresponse |
| **ar clear** | -- | Removes all autoresponses (with a prompt) |
| **ar [channel\|cs] &lt;trigger&gt; &lt;response&gt;** | !ar channel "king crimson" HOW DOES KING CRIMSON WORK I DON'T UNDERSTAND | Like a normal autoresponse except it only listens in the channel you used the command in. **Note:** This will bypass any channel ignores (member ignores still work). |
| **ar ignore &lt;members or channels...&gt;** | !ar ignore @Carl#0001 @Kintark#0588 #general  @idiotuser#1337 \#welcome | Blocks channels and or users from triggering responses |
| **ar unignore &lt;members or channels...&gt;** | !ar unignore #general @Carl#0001 | Undoes what !ar ignore does |

Autoreactions support most of tagscript, see [Tags - Advanced usage to learn more](https://docs.carl.gg/tags-and-triggers/tags-advanced-usage/)
